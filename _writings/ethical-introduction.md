Welcome to the "Ethical Stuff" section! Here, I explore applied analytical ethics with a particular focus on fair algorithms and medical ethics. My current interests include ethical challenges in biomedical policy, fairness in resource allocation, and the design of algorithms that uphold equity and justice.

The questions I'll tackle here involve deep ethical considerations: How do we ensure fairness in algorithmic decision-making? What principles guide ethical organ allocation policies? These discussions aim to bridge the gap between rigorous ethical theory and its real-world applications, particularly in areas where technology and humanity intersect.
