Currently, I'm a Ph.D. student in the physics department at the University of California, Berkeley and a fellow at The Kavli Institute for Ethics, Science, and Societyty. I am broadly interested in graph theory, problems in the foundations of probability theory, complex and stochastic systems, and applications of decision theory to medicine.

Before returning to school I worked as a  Consultant at Deloitte acting as a Scientific Data Analyst primarily for government clients.
